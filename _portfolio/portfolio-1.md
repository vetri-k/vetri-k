# Introduction

This project was inspired by interest in implementation of machine learning techniques. If there are opportunities for improvement, please let me know.
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock and was obtained from Kaggle. Goal of the project is to use Python, data manipulation skills, feature engineering skills and advanced regression techniques to predict sales price for each house.

Dataset consists of 79 explanatory variables (independent variables) and sale prices (dependent variable) describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa and 2919 records. Sales price was provided for 1460 records which is the training set and sales price must be predicted for 1459 records which is the test set.
This project will cover data exploration, data analysis, feature engineering, model fitting, model prediction and model evaluation.
